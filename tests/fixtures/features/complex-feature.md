# Complex Feature

## Overview
This is a complex feature fixture that demonstrates all possible frontmatter fields and relationships.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- User can perform complex operations
- System maintains data integrity
- Real-time updates via WebSockets
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities

### Non-Functional Requirements
- System handles 10,000 concurrent users
- 99.9% uptime requirement
- GDPR compliance
- SOC2 Type II certification

## Implementation Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- Uses event sourcing for audit trail
- Redis for caching frequently accessed data
- Queue system for background processing
- Microservice architecture for scalability

### Security Considerations
- OAuth 2.0 with PKCE
- Rate limiting per user and IP
- Input sanitization and validation
- Encrypted data at rest and in transit

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- Authentication system (parent feature)
- User management system
- Notification service

### External Dependencies
- Redis 7.x for caching
- PostgreSQL 15.x for primary database
- Elasticsearch 8.x for search
- WebSocket server for real-time features

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Functionality
- [ ] User can create complex entities
- [ ] System validates all inputs
- [ ] Real-time updates work correctly
- [ ] Search returns accurate results

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] API response time < 100ms for 95% of requests
- [ ] Page load time < 2 seconds
- [ ] Search results in < 500ms

### Security Requirements
- [ ] All endpoints require authentication
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents abuse
- [ ] Sensitive data is encrypted
- [ ] Audit logs capture all changes
