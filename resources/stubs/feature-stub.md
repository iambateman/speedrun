# AI process checklist:
- [] Discover: learn what the developer wants and what is currently in the app.
- [] Plan: write detailed markdown documents in the feature folder with explanations for what to do and sample code.
- [] Execute: implement the code, running tests if applicable, until it's accepted by the developer.
- [] Clean up: run `php artisan speedrun:feature:clean {slug}` to remove the working directory.
